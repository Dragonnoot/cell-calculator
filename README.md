### ShortHands

In comments and commit messages I use my own "shorthands" or abbreviations. 
Here's how I create the shorthands.

Example:

equation = equ::

And there's still plurality:

equations = equ::s


For words with similar beginnings, an extra "chunk" is added to the abbreviation:

  - nucleotides = nuc:t:s
  - nucleic acids = nuc:\a:s ⬅️Backslash is there because without it it tries to make an emoji but normally it's just a
  - nucleosis = nuc:s:s

Formed as:

  - x = beginning
  - y = notable letter or blank
  - z = s or blank depending on plurality
  - x:y:z

Shorthand list:
  // Note that there are also normal abbreviations:
  
  - Vol - volume
  - u - µ / micro
  - equ:: - Equation
  - UI - User Interface
  - p:: Planet
